            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>Although I have not yet had formal work experience in C programming, I have actively sought to deepen my knowledge through hands-on exploration of various key concepts in the language. I have become proficient in fundamental programming skills, such as understanding data types, control structures, and functions. My exploration of pointers and memory management has given me insight into how memory is handled in C, including dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. I have also worked on building simple algorithms, such as sorting and searching, and have explored data structures like arrays, linked lists, and stacks. Additionally, I have familiarized myself with basic debugging techniques.</p>
